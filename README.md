# Tool used
  React, Typescript.
  
# Functionalities
- Users are able to enter as many educational experiences as they please;
- When the user is typing the name of the school they went, it should be auto completed using an API call. (Public api can be found here: http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?name=) 
- Users can enter the following information: Name of School, Degree, Field of study, Start year, End Year (Or expected), Grade, a Description field, and anything else you wish to add.

# Goals

Implement the screens based off the wireframes and api above using advanced techniques and industry best practices for your platform. Note that the wireframes may not be complete, so use your best judgment for UI/UX implementation. 

## Introduction and Home screen:

- Static text
- Input field for user
- Enter button takes user to the Main screen

## Main screen

- Dynamic text
- Button to open up new modal to add a new education component
- Side panel acts as a bookmark menu of the list of education added
- Each new education added should appear above the previous, i.e. descending order of most recent

## Add education modal

- Background Main screen should dim down when modal opens
- Modal allows the user to add the relevant information and save it.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
